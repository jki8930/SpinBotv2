# Project Overview

This is a Python project for a Telegram bot, built using the `aiogram` framework. The project is in its initial state, with a simple "Hello from tgspin!" message printed when the `main.py` script is executed.

## Building and Running

**Dependencies:**

The project's dependencies are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file. The primary dependency is:

*   `aiogram>=3.22.0`

**Running the bot:**

To run the bot, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

**TODO:** Add instructions on how to configure the Telegram bot token.

## Development Conventions

*   The project uses `uv` for dependency management.
*   The Python version required is `>=3.11`.
